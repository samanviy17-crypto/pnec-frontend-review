# PNEC isolated review snapshot

This directory contains source only, with no Git history, production secrets,
user data, deployment workflows or active custom-domain/server configuration.
Do not publish or deploy without separate approval. See SOURCE-NOTES.md.
Use loopback-only local previews and synthetic tests; do not point at production.
The frontend uses reserved .invalid review API fallbacks outside localhost.
Private service credentials belong outside source control. Safe examples are
provided; never overwrite an existing environment. Read SECURITY.md before review.

## Validate locally

Use a separate Python environment with backend requirements plus frontend
requirements-dev.txt installed; no environment or dependency directory is bundled.
From the backend snapshot, run `python -B -m pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider`.
From any temporary working directory, run:

```sh
python -B /path/frontend/scripts/run-release-tests.py --frontend-root /path/frontend --backend-root /path/backend
```

The runner creates disposable build/state outside source. It blocks external APIs;
its responsive test blocks ALL external requests. Keep the local preview on loopback.
The frontend also has four offline unit suites: run `npm test` with Node installed.
No npm dependency installation is required. Ruby dependencies are pinned in the
frontend Gemfile/Gemfile.lock; `bundle check` validates an installed environment.
No production workflow, server config, credentials or deployment helper is present.

## Known review limitations

The optional preparedness RPG wrapper is included, but two legacy game engines
are absent upstream and the mansion-game classroom fallback is excluded pending
PNEC scope approval. See frontend RPG-LIMITATIONS.md and the external validation
report. Do not claim gameplay completeness from the quiz regression.
The offline responsive suite retains its desktop negative-margin assertion; it
fails with 0px because the external WordPress theme is not fetched. Twelve
viewport width/video bounds checks pass. External-theme visual equivalence and
live provider/SMTP/production database behavior are NOT certified.

## Publication boundary

These are file snapshots with no Git history, not yet GitHub repositories.
Publishing requires separate approval after the manifest/hash review and GitHub
App/automation scope confirmation. Do not copy deployment workflows or CNAME into
a new default branch: an initial push could otherwise run main-triggered jobs.
Keep future review repositories private, Actions disabled, Pages unconfigured,
and production credentials/integrations absent. No merge or deployment is approved.

## Finalization decision record

The RPG remains visible and unremoved; RPG-LIMITATIONS.md proposes an explicit
owner-approved deferral or a fully audited PNEC implementation. Core resident
workflows do not require it. No complete local WordPress theme bundle has been
located. The retained responsive assertion is not waived or satisfied by an
invented negative margin: it continues to fail when external theme CSS is blocked.
Available deployment/App metadata is insufficient to certify first-push isolation;
account owners must confirm that new private review repositories are not
implicitly enrolled in account-wide deployment integrations.
